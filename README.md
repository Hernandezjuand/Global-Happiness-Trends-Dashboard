# Global Happiness Trends Dashboard

## Introduction to the Dataset

The World Happiness Report dataset provides annual data from 2015 to 2023, offering insights into global happiness trends. Sourced from the World Happiness Report available on Kaggle, this dataset includes key indicators such as GDP per capita, social support, healthy life expectancy, generosity, and perceptions of corruption.

## Data Transformation

To ensure data accuracy and consistency, we performed data cleaning and preparation. This process included handling missing values, removing duplicates, and normalizing the indexes across the dataset. Tables from different years were joined to create a unified dataset, allowing for comprehensive analysis. Additionally, calculated metrics were developed to provide deeper insights into happiness trends, such as year-over-year changes in happiness scores and other key performance indicators (KPIs).

## Key Insights

The global average happiness score has increased over recent years, reflecting improvements in overall well-being. Nordic countries like Finland and Denmark consistently top the rankings, showcasing the success of their social and economic policies. Conversely, nations such as Afghanistan and Syria face significant challenges, including conflict and instability, which contribute to their lower happiness scores. Factors like social support and freedom to make life choices are crucial in determining happiness.
